After clicking the add button, a sponsor is asked to fill in the details and to add funds by sending them to the address behind the QR-code.

Here we see what the screen looks like when it is filled in:

## Webshop with bike subsidy

After adding the subsidy it is placed in the webshop. A user can now request it.

## Requesting the bike subsidy modal

After the product is requested, the records of the user are checked with the criteria of the subsidy. If they match, the user is granted the subsidy. If they don't match, the user is asked to gather additional validations.

## After adding validations for the bike subsidy
![forus io - mvp-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30194799/38660350-31a7ffd6-3e2d-11e8-9522-ac7daeb3d608.png)  
The user has now added the validations to their records, this means that they can now buy a bike with one of the providers. At this screen they will learn about the providers that can deliver their bikes.
