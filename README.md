# Concept

Platform Forus is a decentralized open framework. The main interaction on the platform is as follows: any sponsor (municipality/charity) creates a fund, sets up criteria, assigns validators and pledges budget or products. A validator (trusted party, hospital, municipality) signs information and adds it to the identity of the requester. The requester (citizen, company) applies for the funds or product/service they would like to obtain if information in the identity of the requester matches the criteria of the fund (checked by smart contract) the requester can now get the product/service from a provider (after showing a voucher, or by ordering online). The provider (shop, caretaker) supplies the ordered product and / or service. The funds flow directly from the fund to the provider, leaving the requester with the product/service they requested.

By building the framework on blockchain and other decentralized technologies there is no central party on which others are dependent. Each user holds and controls their own (signed) information and assets with their self- sovereign identity making the information re-usable in other contexts as well.
